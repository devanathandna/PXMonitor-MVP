  - Top Processes (Name, CPU, Memory): ${context.topProcesses} // The compact string from before
  - Potentially Suspicious Processes: ${context.suspicious}

  Based on the previous conversation and current system data, provide a clear, plain-English analysis for the user's question.
  Highlight potential bottlenecks (CPU, memory, disk, or thermals).
  
      IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
      Your response must be friendly, clear, and under 150 words. Structure your answer in three short paragraphs:
      1.  **Diagnosis:** Start by directly answering the user's question and identifying the main issue. (e.g., "Your system is slow right now because a process called 'Memory Compression' is using a lot of CPU.")
      2.  **Context:** Briefly explain what this means in simple terms. (e.g., "Memory Compression is a normal Windows feature that helps manage your RAM, but sometimes it can work too hard, which slows things down.")
      3.  **Recommendation:** Provide 1-2 clear, actionable steps the user can take. (e.g., "A simple restart often resolves this. If the problem continues, you may want to check for any recently installed software that could be using a lot of memory.")

      3.  Your entire response MUST be under 100 words.
      4.  Do NOT give a list of recommendations or suggest further actions. Just provide the risk assessment.

      Example of a good response:
      "Risk Level: Medium. One of your system processes (svchost.exe) is making an unusual connection to a non-Microsoft server. While this could be for a legitimate service, it's worth being aware of. All other connections from applications like Chrome appear normal."
